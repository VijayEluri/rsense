RSense testing

Testing
-------

You can run test scripts easily by

    % make run-test

Writing tests
-------------

Test will be written as a rsense script file. See test scripts which are located in `test/script`. For example, if you want to write a new fixture, add the following code to `test/script/builtin.rsense`.

    type-inference --test=NeedToTest? --should-be=Fixnum
    1_|_
    EOF

After that, do `make run-test`. It's very easy.

As we see, special options for testing are available on type-inference and code-completion command. `--test=` option names its fixture. `--should-be=` option verifies a result equals expected data. `--should-be-empty` option verifies a result is empty. `--should-contain=` option verifies a result contains expected data. `--should-not-contain` option verifies a result doesn't contain unexpected data.
