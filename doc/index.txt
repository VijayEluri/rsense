What is RSense?
---------------

RSense is a development tools for [Ruby][], which is written by Java. Following [unix philosophy][], RSense can be used from a terminal easily as an unix command. And also, it can be used as a background daemon which is used from editors such as Emacs, Vim, etc. We are struggling to keep a transparency for hackers to learn, extend, and fix easily.
